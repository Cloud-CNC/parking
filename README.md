## FAQ

### Isn't this name-squatting?

No. [According to NPM](https://docs.npmjs.com/policies/disputes#squatting),
> It is against npm's Terms of Use to publish a package, register a user name or an organization
> name simply for the purposes of reserving it for future use.

> Package names are considered squatted if the package has no genuine function.

This package serves several purposes:
  * Prevent a malicious actor from impersonating Cloud CNC
  ([NPM's dispute policy](https://docs.npmjs.com/policies/disputes#when-to-use-this-process)
  explicitly permits this after-the-fact)
  * Prevent a malicious actor distributing malware
  ([NPM themselves do this](https://github.com/npm/security-holder) after-the-fact, as well)
  * Guide users to the official Cloud CNC documentation

### Are their future plans for this package?

Nope. If you have a good idea (that relates to Cloud CNC), feel free to open an issue.

### What packages are parked?

Just `cloud-cnc`.
